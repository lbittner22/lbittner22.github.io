                <h2>Why Felvidek stands out</h2>
                <p>
                    Felvidek is a strange, low-fi game set in a fictionalized Central Europe. It mixes
                    historical references, surreal horror, and dry humor in a way that feels very unique.

            <h3>What I like about it</h3>
            <p>
                Felvidek was a game unlike anything I'd played before. It has a classic PS1 era look to it, but it had something special to it. You played as this alcoholic catholic knight, who just lost his wife, wandering around the surrounding European kingdom. The whole game you have this priest following you around, making sarcastic comments about your drinking and general incompetence. The game world is full of strange characters and unsettling situations, but it all feels tied together by this weird sense of humor and melancholy. Turn-based combat is not usually my thing, but they do it from a first-person perspective, which makes it feel more immersive. Overall, Felvidek left a strong impression on me because of its unique blend of art style, storytelling, and atmosphere.
